# Mono-and-Color Polarization Demosaicking

Code and dataset for paper: Polarization Demosaicking for Monochrome and Color Polarization Focal Plane Arrays

[Project Page](https://vccimaging.org/Publications/Simeng2019PolarizationDemosaic/) | [Paper](https://vccimaging.org/Publications/Simeng2019PolarizationDemosaic/Simeng2019PolarizationDemosaic.pdf) | [Supplementary](https://vccimaging.org/Publications/Simeng2019PolarizationDemosaic/Simeng2019PolarizationDemosaicSupplement.pdf)

This code is based on MATLAB.

## Code Setup
Uplaod .mat file of scenes according to the dataset. Mono-polar and Color-polar demosaicking require different parameters.

## Dataset: 

## ![Dataset gallery ](Figure/gallery.jpg)

Dataset from [here](https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/handle/10754/631914) has two groups of images, normal illumination and polarized illumination. 
* Polarized illumination:

## Intensity Images (Ground Truth)
This work is start from solveing Stokes vectors. If your implementation is begin from mosic images, just simply run our monochrome and color main code until "I_capture", which is a calculation of mosic intensiy image.
